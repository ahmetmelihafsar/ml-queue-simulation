# Things to do:
- Move next_finish_possibility and new_customer_possibility variables from Server class to Queue class.
- Create a new file that takes the average of multiple iterations of simulation instances.
- Create adequate tests to easily benchmark different algorithms.
- Implement machine learning logic into a new server class.
- Different finish and new customer possibilities based on time.
